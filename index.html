                California is one of the most populous states in the nation, with a strong economy built around technological innovation.
                Over the past two decades, its population has continued to grow as more and more people flock to the state in pursuit of 
                success. Below is a plot of the state's population trend over time.

                It's clear that California's population has grown immensely over time. However, there's something interesting about the past few years
                that stands out: California's population has seen a clear dip starting right before the start of the new decade. California,
                the supposed golden state where everyone wanted to live, suddenly didn't seem to be like a hot ticket. This piqued our interest, and we set out to find
                how migration patterns were shifting in California, focusing on two times of crisis: 2008 and the start of the 2020s.

                This visualization shows the migration trends from California to other states in the USA.
                The data highlights the number of people moving from California to various states across the country.

                The arrows indicate significant migration flows, where more than 10,000 people have moved from California
                to the respective states. Hover over the states to see more details about the migration numbers.

                The map shows a pretty healthy mix of migration both towards and from California. One trend that stands out is where 
                people are going to from California, and where they're coming from. The east coast seems to be the most popular immigrators 
                for California, while former Californians stay in the West, flocking mostly north or towards Texas, the most popular state to 
                go to from California. These trends for the most part however drastically change when looking at 2022 data.

                What's obvious from the above visualization is that migration away from California has become far more popular than migration
                to California. In fact, there is only one state with a significant level of migration to California: New Jersey. The vast majority 
                of people are traveling to other states, and the number of states with significant level of migration away from California has also
                significantly increased. Overall, we can now see clearly why population in California has dipped/flatilined in recent years: people are 
                moving away and not enough people are coming in.
            </p>

                What makes this even more interesting is where people are going to from California. The previous map showed people staying in the West, either moving north 
                or specifically to Texas. While this remains in 2022, what's fascinating is how many people are now moving into the south, in states like
                Alabama and Tennessee. Overall, as compared to 2008, people migrating from California have branched out which regions they would be willing to go to.

                To explore this further, we focused on 3 specific aspects about California that could be causing migration: housing prices,
                taxes, and job opportunity. Hover over each of the icons below to learn more about these:

                As you can see above, California is 2nd in housing prices as well as first in overall income tax rate. Essentially,
                it's very pricy to live in California, providing incentive to people to move further south where housing and taxes are cheaper.
                What's even more interesting is that two of the states people are moving to the most, Florida and Texas, are in the top 10 in job growth
                in recent years. This shows another reason why people could be moving to those states: there's simply more of an economic opportunity there than in California, 
                a fascinating role-reversal to what we're used to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, California is still the most populous and prosperous state in the country. However, times could be changing. As California
                remains expensive for more and more people, the way we see the state could change forever.
